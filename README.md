# Movies
Sample app - Shows current box-office and top-rated movies using TMDB's API

Note - you will need to get a valid (free) API key from TMDB.org to use this app (see link below)
https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started

Once you have an API key just open Movies.xcworkspace and under "Movies/Constants.swift" replace the string "insert_your_api_key_here" with your API key (keep this key private)

This project uses CocoaPods (https://cocoapods.org/) - make sure you have CocoaPods installed ('sudo gem install cocoapods') and then cd into your cloned project repository and run 'pod install'
